Hello!  
I'm currently a contracted private tutor who specializes in graduate level applied quantiative and/or spatial analysis!
I'm also in the works of launching my own private tutoring brand: >>Stay-Ahead-Tutors- -->!
Check out my website so far, hosted and applying my nginx configurations and node.js API present ed in my "NginX_node.js_PostgreSQL--STACK" github page!  Happy Hosting!
and check me out if you nerds need any help learning the basics of R or perhaps ArcGIS Suite. 
      I'd offer my java skills, but unless you're using github, and still having trouble with
            introductory to intermediate algorythms and datastructures, you're probababaly applying object oriented languages at level above me.
        
See before I can learn more advanced usage and professional applications, I must master the basics.  This has let me down a road realizing that modern computerscience is a mess!
The profits created by most new products and advancements in computer science are higher than the actual value of the products themselves.... this leads to cyclically repeating
mistakes, fixes, and creations throughout today's technology.  We must not only all take a step back, and finish our RESPONSIBILITY to understand the history, full stack, and 
scope of all our current programming, but we must MUCH BETTER set up our next generation for success.  This requires a CORE CURRICULUM for middle school students, that isn't
outdated, overly-abstracted, and otherwise just overall crappy, leading to another generation of 15% of the people understanding technology, and the other 85% scared and just
shoveling money over to over-valued crap, issued by massive, unwatched conglomerates running ammock, having very poor levels of responsibility, competition, and pressure from
knowledgable consumers forcing a high bar of ethics.

Anywho, I also like baseball.
